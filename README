ncursesOS
============

Imagine an operating system that seamlessly blends modern functionalities with a
nostalgic, traditional aesthetic. The ncursesOS project is designed to
provide a minimalistic environment that prioritises text-based user interaction
over graphical interfaces.

ncursesOS is a Text User Interface (TUI)-centric operating system, prioritises
efficiency and simplicity through its command-line interface (CLI). While the
operating system itself is entirely CLI-based, it also offers the ability to
display images, videos, and other graphical media, allowing users to interact
with content without compromising on its minimalist design.

THIS IS A HOBBY PROJECT! ncursesOS is not intended for bare-metal installation,
except for those who wish to explore its inner workings.
